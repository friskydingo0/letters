Show an alphabet on the screen

Ask the player what comes X letters before or after the shown alphabet

There is a timer running. So the player needs to answer soon

Timer can be cumulative. So the faster you play earlier on in the game, the more time you will have for later difficulties

Difficulty can be based on the number of letters offset AND or OR timer reduction
